Q1 : Merges the training and the test sets to create one dataset
  Read the test labels and test set files
      variable testsubject : subject who performed the activity (test group)
      variable testlabels : activity performed (test group)
      variable testdata : measures for the activity/ subject (test group)
      variable testtraininfo : gives the information that it is the test group
    
  Create test dataset including subject and label
      addtest : data frame with testtraininfo, testlabels, testsubject, testdata

  Read the train labels and train set files
      variable trainsubject : subject who performed the activity (training group)
      variable trainlabels : activity performed (training group)
      variable traindata : measures for the activity/ subject (training group)
      variable testtraininfo : gives the information that it is the training group

  create train dataset inclunding subject and label
      addtrain : data frame with trainsubject, trainlabels, traindata, testtraininfo
  
  create dataset inclunding subject, label, train and test data
      onedataset : data frame with addtrain and addtest info

  rename the first columns of the merged dataframe
      keepnames <- colnames(onedataset[4:564])
      colnames(onedataset) <- c("info", "activity", "subject", keepnames)

Q2 : Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  meanSD : data frame with only mean and sd (select from onedataset)
  
Q3 : Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  Loop to rename the activities based on the number of the activity (from 1 to 6) using gsub to replace the name 
  add the column meanSDact containing the name of the activity to meanSD
  delete the column with the number of the activity
  Change the order of the columns to get the activity label in the second column of meanSD data frame

Q4 : Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  Variable features : store the feature data
  colnamesdata : get the variable names of meanSD, remove the "V" in the column names
  colnamesdata : convert colnamesdata in a data frame, rename the column "colcheck"
  Rename the column of features data frame into colcheck and variable
  Merge the colnamesdata and features data frame by colcheck

Q5 : calculate the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  Convert columns 4 to 61 of meanSD into numeric variables
  meanSD2 : select columns 2 to 61 from meanSD
  byactisub : group the data of meanSD2 by activity and subject
  resfinal : calculate the mean on groupped data
  write the result into a csv file.
